# Project1

Primary Goal:

- To design a primitive web crawler that will begin with a given HTML (seed) and identify every Hyperlink embedded within the webpage.

- Each Hyperlink is added to a given Queue to be visited at a later time during Runtime.

- The Hyperlink Queue expands until it reaches a predetermined capacity, called 'n' inputted by the user.

Nice Feature(s) to think about Implementing:

- Tag (perhaps by storing them in another data structure) each Hyperlink whose page contains a given keyword or phrase to be returned by the web crawler.
