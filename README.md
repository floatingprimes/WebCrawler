# Project1

Primary Goal:

- To design a primitive web crawler that begins with a predetermined URL seed and crawls to a limit given before runtime.

- The path of the crawler will be returned after either:
    1.) The crawler has reached its user-determined limit of pages to crawler
    2.) The queue of Links to explore has been exhausted

- Duplicates will not be displayed in the final pathway of the crawler.

- You may implement this solution using any external libraries, so long as you understand how they work.


Desirable Features to think about Implementing:

- Tag (perhaps by storing them in another data structure) each Hyperlink whose page contains a user-determined            keyword or phrase.

- Return the Data Structure of "hits" when finished.
